NOTE:
* can we manually add "orring" to all regular expressions
and if not which ones did it change and how. if this is the case
the element of sequence now exists.
wed need a regex that splits the regex into a collection 
of ordered literals that we wish to match, literally.

and then enabling multiline flag


#IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES (PRIORITY)
[ ]. Implement capability to read test cases from CSV file for ultra convenience in the future
[ ]. Patterns are matched strictly by line. i.e., if you pass only one
literal with 'anything goes' ('.*') delimiters, it will fail
unless there is one line that matches that pattern.

	we want 'hello.*world 4' to work with the following input:
		hello\n
		world 4
	however it only works if the entire literal is found on one line, like:
		hello world 4\n

	Solutions?
		* concatinate all lines from stdin into one string
		* use a different matching function from 're' module, would require huge re-write
		* setup two cases:
			- there is one literal, here we assume we want to check pattern for all lines
			- there are multiple literals, here we assume we want to check each literal's
			  possible presence on one isolated line

[ ]. You cannot seperately search for or interpret patterns unless they are seperated
with '|'. 

	If you pass my program 'hello*.world 4', the program will not allow you to 'FOUND' 'hello' but 'NOT FOUND' 'world 4'. It either finds this one pattern or it doesn't. This occurs because in RegEx, the pattern 'hello*.world 4' is one literal to be matched. To search for 'hello' and 'world 4' as seperate literals while using the stdlib RegEx engine, you would have to use the seperator '|'. You side stepped this issue by not using RegEx, and parsing it yourself as to allow
	insight into the intermediate steps of the matching process, thus allowing the program
	to present exactly what was found and where it was found, as well as what was not found.

	This works great for a very restricted scope of test cases, at a cost to scalability. Any 
	future 'RegEx' patterns you wish to extend the program with will require manual implementation. I implemented a different model in my Python code. The RegEx stdlib gives you plenty of default insight into this matching process if you express your pattern as a '|' seperared sequence of literals. Here they are parsed as seperate patterns to be matched. In fact, every literal is represented as an object with lots of needed information. This model has an additional benefit in that the matching process will not terminate on the first unfound literal. This is especially useful when we are trying to present refined feedback. 

	However, the idea of sequence is lost as '|' is the RegEx 'or' operator and instead of looking for the occurence of one pattern 'hello*.world 4', we are only looking for the occurence of both 'hello' and 'world 4' ('hello|world 4') meaning if 'world 4' is found before 'hello' we still have 2 valid literal matches, thus satisfying the entire pattern INCORRECTLY as you pointed out. I believe using stdlib's 'finditer' with the RegEx 'or' operator to seperate literals presents enough benefits (default insight into the intermediate steps of the matching process, no early termination) to where my having to manually implement some element of order into the parser is a negligible use of time in the big picture.

#FINAL
2. implement CI and testing
3. setup Makefile and put program and library in default path for easy global access
4. create public release
